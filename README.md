# Full Screen Application for Library Management System
## Description:
This assignment is based on developing a LIS (Library Management System) using Java
Programming Language. For that I used GUI (Graphical User Interface) in this development so
that it will become more users friendly to interact.
Besides, I also added database to store important data related to the project. 

### Explanations:
This project contains a pdf file called "LMS documentation". It contains all the small details regarding the requirements and set up of the project.
All the steps regarding:
- Required Software
- Project Configurations
- Execution Procedure
- Sign up Procedure
- User GUI (Books, User Books, User Profile)
- Librarian GUI (Editing Books, Adding a new book, Deleting books, editing User Profiles)
- Object Oriented Explanation (ULM Diagram, Main Classes and Methods, Polymorphism and Inheritance)

### For more information, please look inside the pdf file "LMS Documentation".
Although, it should be kept in mind that the documentation does not fully cover the application.
And for the full experience, you might need the set up.
